WP Embeddable allows you to create and embed any content from your WordPress site into posts, pages, or other sites.

== Description ==

WP Embeddable allows you to embed any content from your WordPress site into posts, pages, or other sites.

For example, you can use the plugin to create embeddables for contact forms on your site that can be embedded in other sites.

For another example, you can create an embeddable with content from a plugin, like a calendar widget. This embeddable can then be used on page on the same site, serving as a way to isolate content from the plugin in an `<iframe>`. This can be useful for avoiding CSS style clashes when using page builders with 3rd-party plugins.

== Installation ==

Upload the WP Embeddable plugin to your site and activate it.
