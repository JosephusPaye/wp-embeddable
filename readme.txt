WP Embeddable allows you to create embed codes for any content on your WordPress site, to embed into posts, pages, or other sites.

== Description ==

WP Embeddable allows you to create embed codes for any content on your WordPress site, to embed into posts, pages, or other sites.

You can use the plugin to:

-   Create embeddables for contact forms on your site that can be embedded in other sites.
-   Create an embeddable with content from a plugin, like a calendar widget. This embeddable can then be used on a page on the same site, providing a way to isolate content from the plugin in an `<iframe>`. This can be useful for avoiding CSS style clashes when using different 3rd-party plugins and themes that have conflicting styles.

The plugin allows you to disable `wp_head()` and `wp_footer()` for an embeddable. This is useful for removing all WordPress and third-party scripts and styles from the page header and footer.

== Installation ==

Upload the WP Embeddable plugin to your site and activate it.

== Usage ==

- Install and activate the plugin.
- Go to the **Embeddables** section in the WordPress dashboard and add a new embeddable.
- Use the editor to create the content you want in the embeddable, and publish when done.
- In the sidebar, under the **Embeddable Usage** section, you can copy the shortcode or embed code:
    - Copy the shortcode for use in a page or post on the same site.
    - Copy the embed code for use on another site.
